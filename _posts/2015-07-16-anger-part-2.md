It is a well documented but little known fact that the pain and distress that remains stubbornly attached to the memory of a heavy traumatic event can be triggered and resurface in the mind by an experience of a similar nature.

Depending on the strength and similarity of the trigger, the subject may  well experience some or all of the same upsetting behavioural patterns, negative thoughts or attitudes present at the earlier time.

Even more to the point, where the problem is anger and/or aggression, which can wreck relationships and lead to isolation and other devastating consequences, the solution can often be comparatively quick and easy, providing:

* the subject has a strong desire to deal with the problem and is willing, little by little, to face and talk about some of the key bad memories, that are driving forward such a negative and destructive behavioural pattern.
* there is no heavy current alcohol consumption.
* there is no heavy current drug consumption.
* there is no current or previous history of serious mental illness
