It is correct to consider 'Ego' to the 'Self' or 'I' and egotism to be an overinflated view of ones self - so it is egotism really which is the joint subject of this article.

Either way it is this over inflated view of self that is most clearly evident when that view of self is challenged in the perception of the challenged!

Now we all have certain strong views we may well be liable to "defend to death". I am not referring to this. I am referring to the person who, when talking of his own intellectual ability, likely to say something like "I am never wrong! Oh no, I tell a lie; I was wrong once - it was once when I thoughty I was wrong, and I was right all along!"

Amusing this is at first, this attitude can be highly destructive over time in a relationship. 

In a strong, positive relationship, both parties will be largely nurturing and solicitous to the needs of the other partner with minimal attention on themself.

This is not a form of self effacement and repression; this is how a relationship flourishes as it mimicks the early stage of most, and is colloquially referred to as "cloud nine". From a techincal viewpoint, the flows from each person are most entirely outward, from each to the other. But in reality almost all of us would have no problem in recognising it for what it is - Love!

Sadly this state of grace can easily be interrupted, as life inevitably intervenes with it's problems, difficulties, temptations, financnail social nand familial pressures. 

Whenever this occurs, so the selflessness, the giving, the nurturing and as a consequence the love each for the other, can diminish and be in danger of being replaced by a negative reaction of one or both parties, and the potential upset and distress to both parties, and of course rupture the previous state of the relationship.

In view of the foregoing, we see that the more each partner can keep the other at the centre of their world, to that degree the relationship will continue to flourish and the couple with flourish with it!
